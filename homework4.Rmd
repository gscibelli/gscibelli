The following link is for the data that is used in this Section. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
imf_growth <- read.csv(url('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/imf_growth_quarterly.csv'))
```

- geom_tile() and geom_text() 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
